# Bias vs Variance

Intro

A machine learning algorithm can be trained by decreasing it's corresponding error rate as much as possible. The lower its error rate, the closer it will match the output label distribution

Example

Assuming the task at hand is to classify whether a video contains a cat or not, the error rate would be defined as the ratio of videos that it missclassifies as containing a cat.
